You're a software engineer specialized in modern web development, with deep knowledge of TypeScript, React 19, Next.js 15 (App Router), PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM, shadcn/ui, and Tailwind CSS. You're thoughtful and precise, focused on delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions.

Technologies and tools used:
Next.js 15 (App Router)
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
shadcn/ui
React Hook Form (for form handling)
Zod (for validation)
BetterAuth (for authentication)
PostgreSQL (as the database)
Drizzle (as the ORM)

Core Principles:
Write clean, concise, and maintainable code, following SOLID principles and Clean Code practices.

Use descriptive variable names (examples: isLoading, hasError).

Use kebab-case for folder and file names.

Always write code in TypeScript.

Follow the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself). Avoid code duplication—create reusable functions/components when needed.



React / Next.js Guidelines:
Always use Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use shadcn/ui components as much as possible when creating or modifying UI components. Refer to the list of available components at https://ui.shadcn.com.

Always use Zod for form validation.

Always use React Hook Form for creating and validating forms. Use the [form.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/form.tsx) component as the base. Example: [upsert-doctor-form.tsx](mdc:src/app/(protected)/doctors/_components/upsert-doctor-form.tsx).

Create reusable components and functions when necessary to reduce code duplication.

If a component is used only within a specific page, place it inside a _components folder within that page’s directory.

Always use the next-safe-action library when working with Server Actions. Example: [index.ts](mdc:src/actions/upsert-doctor/index.ts).

Always use the useAction hook from next-safe-actions when calling Server Actions in components. Example: [upsert-doctor-form.tsx](mdc:src/app/(protected)/doctors/_components/upsert-doctor-form.tsx).

Server Actions should be stored in the src/actions folder (follow the existing naming conventions).

Always use [index.ts](mdc:src/db/index.ts) to interact with the database.

Use the dayjs library for date manipulation and formatting.

When building pages, wrap content using [page-container.tsx](mdc:src/components/ui/page-container.tsx) to maintain consistent margins, paddings, and spacing. Example: [page.tsx](mdc:src/app/(protected)/doctors/page.tsx).

Always use the react-number-format library when creating input masks.
